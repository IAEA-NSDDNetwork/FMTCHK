Included with this release is an executable, the source code for both fmtchk and the nndclib library, 
and a Makefile for convenience.  The executable was built and tested on Windows 7, compiling against 
MinGW (http://www.mingw.org).

To build (assuming that MinGw has been installed and the bin directory added to your path)
, go to a command prompt and type:
mingw32-make.exe fmtchk.exe

This also compiles and runs under cygwin with appropriate changes to the Makefile.
